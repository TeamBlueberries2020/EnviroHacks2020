		<p class="NormPara">An estimated 55 million people globally are affected by droughts every year.</p>
      <hr>
		<p class="NormPara">Water scarcity impacts 40% of the world’s population, and as many as 700 million people are at-risk of being displaced as a result of drought by 2030.</p>

		<p class="NormPara">In the United States, people use on average 88 gallons of water a day at home,
			spending about $1000 per year in water costs.</p>
      <hr>
		<p class="NormPara">That adds up to around 2700 gallons per month, or more than 32 thousand gallons of water per year per
			person.
		</p>
    <hr>
		<p class="NormPara">These wasteful water habits could eventually lead to a drought when combined with low precipitation
			levels, in which you may be fined for wasteful water habits.</p>

		<p class="NormPara">If you feel like that is a lot of water being wasted and are starting to feel concerned about the environment,
			we are here to help! Click on the quiz tab to help measure the exact amount of water you use per week. Below are some
			tips and ways you could save on your usage!</p>

    <div class = "facts">
		<p class="NormPara">By replacing old toilets that are not WaterSense labeled models or before 1980, the average family
			would save around 13,000 gallons of water and $130 dollars per year, so the replacement would pay off quickly.
		</p>
    <hr>
		<p class="NormPara">If you have an old dishwasher that is not energy star rated, switching to a new energy-star rated model
			would save at least 2 gallons per DAY, which would be 14 gallons per week and 730 gallons per year, not adding the electricity
			saved as well.</p>
      <hr>
		<p class="NormPara">Also, if your dishwasher was made all the way before 1995, you could be wasting 10 gallons of water
			per day, and that would add up to 3,650 gallons of water per year, so replacing to a new dishwasher that is energy-star
			rated would save TONS of water and lots of money on your utility bill.</p>
      <hr>
		<p class="NormPara">Replacing an old shower head with a newer one would save 2,700 gallons a year, which would bring down
			your utility bill by around 70 dollars.</p>

    <div class = "facts">
		<p class="NormPara">Following at least one of these ways to save water, you would drastically decrease your water footprint,
			save money on your utility bills, help prevent or recover quicker from a drought, and save the environment!</p>
