		<p class="NormPara">Water is one of our most valuable resources on Earth, which unfortunately is limited. However, most of us take our most valuable resource for granted, and use it recklessly which causes droughts. By working together, we can reduce humanity's water footprint and end climate change. Numerous people waste valuable water every day, potentially leading to a drought without clean water. This
			website will help determine how your actions affect the environment, and how you can cut back to save the environment.
		</p>
		<p class="NormPara">By sharing this website to others, you help mitigate the impacts of droughts by spreading
			awareness about wasted water, saving water used for daily tasks,  reducing the long-term economic
			impact of a drought! Thank You!</p>
